  × expected a chemical formula (optionally followed by a '+' or '-' and a
  │ particle offset), or a standalone particle offset
  ├─▶   × expected an element (like Au) or an isotope (like [15N]) optionally
  │     │ followed by a number
  │   
  ╰─▶   × the isotope "Tc-100" could not be found in the supplied atomic
      database,
        │ though the following Technetium isotopes were found: [97, 98, 99]
        help: double-check for typos, or add a new entry to the atomic
