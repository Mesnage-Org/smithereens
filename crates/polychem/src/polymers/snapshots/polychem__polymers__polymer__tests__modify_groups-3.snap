  × failed to apply 1,6-Anhydro modification to residue 0 (N-Acetylmuramic
  │ Acid)
  ╰─▶   × failed to find multiple of the requested free groups
      
      Error:
        × the functional group "Hydroxyl" at="Reducing End" of residue 0 was
        │ already modified, but must be free
      
      Error:
        × expected a target group matching "Hydroxyl" at="Reducing End" of="N-
        │ Acetylmuramic Acid", but got "Hydroxyl" at="6-Position"
