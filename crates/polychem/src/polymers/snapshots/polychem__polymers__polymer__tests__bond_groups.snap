  × failed to form Stem Peptide Crosslink bond between residue 1 (Alanine) and
  │ residue 3 (Lysine) due to an issue with the acceptor
  ╰─▶   × residue 3 contains more than 1 free target group: "Amino" at="N-
        │ Terminal" and "Amino" at="Sidechain"
        help: to resolve this ambiguity, specify the exact functional group
              to modify
