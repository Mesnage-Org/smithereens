  × expected a chemical formula (optionally followed by a '+' or '-' and a
  │ particle offset), or a standalone particle offset
  ├─▶   × expected an element (like Au) or an isotope (like [15N]) optionally
  │     │ followed by a number
  │   
  ├─▶   × expected an isotopic mass number

        help: a 0 value doesn't make sense here, if you've mistakenly included
              a leading zero, like NH02, try just NH2 instead
