  × expected a chemical formula (optionally followed by a '+' or '-' and a
  │ particle offset), or a standalone particle offset
  ├─▶   × expected an element (like Au) or an isotope (like [15N]) optionally
  │     │ followed by a number
  │   
  ╰─▶   × no natural abundance data could be found for Technetium (Tc), though
        │ the following isotopes were found: [97, 98, 99]
        help: consider explicitly selecting the isotope to be used in mass
              calculations — e.g. [97Tc]
