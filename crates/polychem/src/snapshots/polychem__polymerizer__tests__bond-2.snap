expression: out

  × failed to form "Stem" bond between residue 1 (N-Acetylmuramic Acid) and
  │ residue 2 (Alanine) due to an issue with the donor
  ╰─▶   × residue 1 does not belong to the current polymer
        help: the referenced residue was likely created by a different
      Polymerizer
              instance
